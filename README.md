# PDF Extraction Library

## Overview
This Python library is specifically designed to read PDFs from local paths and extract numerical data from structured line items within forms. It aims to provide robust and flexible PDF data extraction, capable of handling various formats and anomalies in data presentation.

## Key Features
- **Read PDFs**: Load PDFs from local storage paths into Python objects.
- **Data Extraction**: Extract and sum numerical values from predefined line item structures within the PDFs.
- **Robust Extraction**: Enhanced to handle various edge cases and anomalies in PDF formats.

## Development Plan and Future Enhancements
- CLI/REST API: Develop a command-line interface and a REST API using FastAPI for interactive and programmable library access.
- Generic Data Extraction: Improve extraction logic to dynamically adapt to different line item labels and formats.
